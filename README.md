## App Components
This is a collection of dead simple essential components that will save you time and boilerplate code.

These are just wrappers around the [Shadcn](https://www.shadcn.com/) components, so you can use them as you would use the originals, but with the additional App features.

## Installation
```bash
npm i @maxpauwels/app-components
```

### What does it do? 
The components include a couple of essential features that you normally end up having to write over and over again, as well as some essential typesafety for your app.

If you haven't used these essential features in your core components, you'll ask yourself why soon enough.


### Components

#### AppButton
The shadcn button but with additional essential props.
- \`loading\` to quickly set the button to a loading state with a spinner and disables the button.
- \`icon\` autocompletes hundreds of icons from the [shadcn-icons](https://www.shadcn.com/icons.html) library. 
- \`label\` to quickly set the button label. (You can also use regular children).
- ... All other shadcn button props.
  
```tsx 
<AppButton
  label="Test"
  loading
  icon="alarm-clock"
  variant="destructive"
/>
```

#### AppNavLink
The shadcn button but with additional essential props.
- \`loading\` to quickly set the button to a loading state with a spinner and disables the button.
- \`icon\` autocompletes hundreds of icons from the [shadcn-icons](https://www.shadcn.com/icons.html) library. 
- \`label\` to quickly set the button label. (You can also use regular children).
- ... All other shadcn button props.

#### Additional props
You'll need to set the role type in the app-config.ts file.
- \`roleRestrictions\` An array of user roles that the button will only display for.
- \`userRole\` set the current user's role from your state.

```tsx 
<AppNavLink href="/demo">Dasboard</AppNavLink>
```

### Config file
The config file is used to set the app variables. It's an extra step, but ends up saving  tons of time because it will autocomplete all your href's, allow you to control user roles, etc.

- \`UserAccountTypes\`: An array of user roles that the button will only display for.
- \`AppNavPaths\`: An array of all your app paths.

```tsx
export type UserAccountTypes = 
|Â "admin" 
| "super-admin" 
| "viewer" 
| "editor";

export type AppNavPaths =
  //Public paths
  | "/"
  | "/about"
  | "/policies/privacy-policy"
  | "/policies/terms-of-service"
  // Auth paths
  | "/auth/sign-in"
  | "/auth/sign-up"
  | "/password-reset"
  // Dashboard paths
  | "/dashboard"
  | "/dashboard/settings"
```
The \`app-config.ts\` should be in the root of your project. You can change the \`AppNavPaths\` with your own App paths. If you don't use user roles, you can set the \`UserAccountTypes\` to an empty string.
